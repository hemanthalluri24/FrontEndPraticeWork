           <p> A Terms and Conditions agreement should include essential clauses that protect your business, define user responsibilities, and mitigate potential legal risks. Think of your Terms and Conditions agreement (often called a T&C) as the rulebook for using your website, app, or service. It's a legally binding contract between you and your users.</p>
